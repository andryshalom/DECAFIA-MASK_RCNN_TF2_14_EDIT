"MASK RCNN FOR GOOGLE COLAB IN 2024"

## Mask R-CNN for Object Detection and Instance Segmentation on Keras and TensorFlow 2.14.0 and Python 3.10.12
This is an implementation of the [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) paper which edits the original [Mask_RCNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) repository (which only supports TensorFlow 1.x), so that it works with Python 3.10.12 and TensorFlow 2.14.0. This new reporsitory allows to train and test (i.e make predictions) the Mask R-CNN  model in TensorFlow 2.14.0. The Mask R-CNN model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of an object in the image. It's based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a ResNet101 backbone.

Compared to the source code of the old [Mask_RCNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) repo, the  edits the following 2 modules:

1. `model.py`
2. `utils.py`

Apart from that, this repository uses the same training and testing code as in the old repo and similarly includes:

* Source code of Mask R-CNN built on FPN and ResNet101.
* Training code for MS COCO
* Pre-trained weights for MS COCO
* Jupyter notebooks to visualize the detection pipeline at every step
* ParallelModel class for multi-GPU training
* Evaluation on MS COCO metrics (AP)
* Example of training on your own dataset

## Requirements
The [Mask-RCNN_TF2.14.0](https://github.com/z-mahmud22/Mask-RCNN_TF2.14.0) repo is tested with TensorFlow 2.14.0, Keras 2.14.0, and Python 3.10.12 for the following system specifications:

1. GPU - `GeForce RTX 3060 12GiB` , `Tesla T4 16GiB` (Google colab)
2. OS -  `Linux 5.15.120+, Ubuntu20.04, Windows 10 and Windows 11`
3. Cloud - `Google colab`

Other common packages required for this repo are listed in `requirements.txt` and `environment.yml`.

### MS COCO Requirements:
To train or test on MS COCO, you'll also need:
* `pycocotools` (installation instructions below)
* [MS COCO Dataset](http://cocodataset.org/#home)
* Download the 5K [minival](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/o43o90bna78omob/instances_minival2014.json.zip?dl=0)
  and the 35K [validation-minus-minival](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/s3tw5zcg7395368/instances_valminusminival2014.json.zip?dl=0)
  subsets. More details in the original [Faster R-CNN implementation](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn/blob/master/data/README.md).

# Use the Repository Without Installation
It is not required to build the repo. It is enough to copy the `mrcnn` directory to where you are using it.

Please follow these steps to use the repo for making predictions:

1. Create a root directory (e.g. maskrcnn)
2. Copy the [mrcnn](mcnn) directory inside the root directory. 
3. Download the pre-trained MS COCO weights inside the root directory from this link: https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/releases/download/v2.0/mask_rcnn_coco.h5
4. Create a script for object detection and save it inside the root directory. This script is an example: [mrcnn-prediction.py](mrcnn-prediction.py). The next section will walkthrough this sample script.
5. Run the script.

The directory tree of the repo is as follows:
```
maskrcnn:
├───mrcnn:
├───mask_rcnn_coco.h5
└───mask-rcnn-prediction.py
```

# Code for Prediction/Inference
This sample code uses the pre-trained MS COCO weights of the Mask R-CNN model which can be downloaded from this link: https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/releases/download/v2.0/mask_rcnn_coco.h5. The code is accessible through the samples/mrcnn-prediction.py script.

The [MS COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#home) dataset has 80 classes. There is an additional class for the background named **BG**. Thus, the total number of classes is 81. The classes names are listed in the `CLASS_NAMES` list. **DO NOT CHANGE THE ORDER OF THE CLASSES.**

After making prediction with this code: 
```python
import mrcnn
import mrcnn.config
import mrcnn.model
import mrcnn.visualize
import cv2
import os

# load the class label names from disk, one label per line
# CLASS_NAMES = open("coco_labels.txt").read().strip().split("\n")

CLASS_NAMES = ['BG', 'person', 'bicycle', 'car', 'motorcycle', 'airplane', 'bus', 'train', 'truck', 'boat', 'traffic light', 'fire hydrant', 'stop sign', 'parking meter', 'bench', 'bird', 'cat', 'dog', 'horse', 'sheep', 'cow', 'elephant', 'bear', 'zebra', 'giraffe', 'backpack', 'umbrella', 'handbag', 'tie', 'suitcase', 'frisbee', 'skis', 'snowboard', 'sports ball', 'kite', 'baseball bat', 'baseball glove', 'skateboard', 'surfboard', 'tennis racket', 'bottle', 'wine glass', 'cup', 'fork', 'knife', 'spoon', 'bowl', 'banana', 'apple', 'sandwich', 'orange', 'broccoli', 'carrot', 'hot dog', 'pizza', 'donut', 'cake', 'chair', 'couch', 'potted plant', 'bed', 'dining table', 'toilet', 'tv', 'laptop', 'mouse', 'remote', 'keyboard', 'cell phone', 'microwave', 'oven', 'toaster', 'sink', 'refrigerator', 'book', 'clock', 'vase', 'scissors', 'teddy bear', 'hair drier', 'toothbrush']

class SimpleConfig(mrcnn.config.Config):
    # Give the configuration a recognizable name
    NAME = "coco_inference"
    
    # set the number of GPUs to use along with the number of images per GPU
    GPU_COUNT = 1
    IMAGES_PER_GPU = 1

    # Number of classes = number of classes + 1 (+1 for the background). The background class is named BG
    NUM_CLASSES = len(CLASS_NAMES)

# Initialize the Mask R-CNN model for inference and then load the weights.
# This step builds the Keras model architecture.
model = mrcnn.model.MaskRCNN(mode="inference", 
                             config=SimpleConfig(),
                             model_dir=os.getcwd())

# Load the weights into the model.
# Download the mask_rcnn_coco.h5 file from this link: https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/releases/download/v2.0/mask_rcnn_coco.h5
model.load_weights(filepath="mask_rcnn_coco.h5", 
                   by_name=True)

# load the input image, convert it from BGR to RGB channel
image = cv2.imread("test.jpg")
image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# Perform a forward pass of the network to obtain the results
r = model.detect([image], verbose=0)

# Get the results for the first image.
r = r[0]

# Visualize the detected objects.
mrcnn.visualize.display_instances(image=image, 
                                  boxes=r['rois'], 
                                  masks=r['masks'], 
                                  class_ids=r['class_ids'], 
                                  class_names=CLASS_NAMES, 
                                  scores=r['scores'])
```

It displays the input image by drawing the bounding boxes, masks, class labels, and prediction scores over all detected objects:

**From here onwards, all the instructions are quoted from the old [Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) repository:**
# Getting Started
* [mask-rcnn-prediction.py](samples/mask-rcnn-prediction.py): A script for loading the pre-trained weights and making predictions using the Mask R-CNN model.

* [coco_labels.txt](samples/coco_labels.txt): The class labels of the COCO dataset.

* [demo.ipynb](samples/demo.ipynb): is the easiest way to start. It shows an example of using a model pre-trained on MS COCO to segment objects in your own images. It includes code to run object detection and instance segmentation on arbitrary images.

* [train_shapes.ipynb](samples/shapes/train_shapes.ipynb): shows how to train Mask R-CNN on your own dataset. This notebook introduces a toy dataset (Shapes) to demonstrate training on a new dataset.

* ([model.py](mcnn/model.py), [utils.py](mcnn/utils.py), [config.py](mcnn/config.py)): These files contain the main Mask RCNN implementation.

* [inspect_data.ipynb](samples/coco/inspect_data.ipynb): This notebook visualizes the different pre-processing steps to prepare the training data.

* [inspect_model.ipynb](samples/coco/inspect_model.ipynb): This notebook goes in depth into the steps performed to detect and segment objects. It provides visualizations of every step of the pipeline.

* [inspect_weights.ipynb](samples/coco/inspect_weights.ipynb): This notebook inspects the weights of a trained model and looks for anomalies and odd patterns.

# Step by Step Detection
To help with debugging and understanding the model, there are 3 notebooks ([inspect_data.ipynb](samples/coco/inspect_data.ipynb), [inspect_model.ipynb](samples/coco/inspect_model.ipynb), [inspect_weights.ipynb](samples/coco/inspect_weights.ipynb)) that provide a lot of visualizations and allow running the model step by step to inspect the output at each point. Here are a few examples:

## 1. Anchor Sorting and Filtering 
Visualizes every step of the first stage Region Proposal Network and displays positive and negative anchors along with anchor box refinement.
![](assets/detection_anchors.png)

## 2. Bounding Box Refinement
This is an example of final detection boxes (dotted lines) and the refinement applied to them (solid lines) in the second stage.
![](assets/detection_refinement.png)

## 3. Mask Generation
Examples of generated masks. These then get scaled and placed on the image in the right location.
![](assets/detection_masks.png)

## 4.Layer Activations
Often it's useful to inspect the activations at different layers to look for signs of trouble (all zeros or random noise).
![](assets/detection_activations.png)

## 5. Weight Histograms
Another useful debugging tool is to inspect the weight histograms. These are included in the [inspect_weights.ipynb](samples/coco/inspect_weights.ipynb) notebook.
![](assets/detection_histograms.png)

## 6. Logging to TensorBoard
[TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) is another great debugging and visualization tool. The model is configured to log losses and save weights at the end of every epoch.

# Training on MS COCO
We're providing pre-trained weights for MS COCO to make it easier to start. You can
use those weights as a starting point to train your own variation on the network.
Training and evaluation code is in `samples/coco/coco.py`. You can import this
module in Jupyter notebook (see the provided notebooks for examples) or you
can run it directly from the command line as such:

```
# Train a new model starting from pre-trained COCO weights
python3 samples/coco/coco.py train --dataset=/path/to/coco/ --model=coco

# Train a new model starting from ImageNet weights
python3 samples/coco/coco.py train --dataset=/path/to/coco/ --model=imagenet

# Continue training a model that you had trained earlier
python3 samples/coco/coco.py train --dataset=/path/to/coco/ --model=/path/to/weights.h5

# Continue training the last model you trained. This will find
# the last trained weights in the model directory.
python3 samples/coco/coco.py train --dataset=/path/to/coco/ --model=last
```

You can also run the COCO evaluation code with:
```
# Run COCO evaluation on the last trained model
python3 samples/coco/coco.py evaluate --dataset=/path/to/coco/ --model=last
```

The training schedule, learning rate, and other parameters should be set in `samples/coco/coco.py`.

# Training on Your Own Dataset

Start by reading this [blog post about the balloon color splash sample](https://engineering.matterport.com/splash-of-color-instance-segmentation-with-mask-r-cnn-and-tensorflow-7c761e238b46). It covers the process starting from annotating images to training and then using the results in a sample application.

In summary, to train the model on your own dataset, you'll need to extend two classes:

```Config```
This class contains the default configuration. Subclass it and modify the attributes you need to change.

```Dataset```
This class provides a consistent way to work with any dataset. 
It allows you to use new datasets for training without having to change 
the code of the model. It also supports loading multiple datasets at the
same time, which is useful if the objects you want to detect are not 
all available in one dataset. 

See examples in `samples/shapes/train_shapes.ipynb`, `samples/coco/coco.py`, `samples/balloon/balloon.py`, and `samples/nucleus/nucleus.py`.

## Differences from the Official Paper
This implementation follows the [Mask RCNN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) for the most part, but there are a few cases where we deviated in favor of code simplicity and generalization. These are some of the differences we're aware of. If you encounter other differences, please do let us know.

* **Image Resizing:** To support training multiple images per batch we resize all images to the same size. For example, 1024x1024px on MS COCO. We preserve the aspect ratio, so if an image is not square we pad it with zeros. In the paper the resizing is done such that the smallest side is 800px and the largest is trimmed at 1000px.
* **Bounding Boxes**: Some datasets provide bounding boxes and some provide masks only. To support training on multiple datasets we opted to ignore the bounding boxes that come with the dataset and generate them on the fly instead. We pick the smallest box that encapsulates all the pixels of the mask as the bounding box. This simplifies the implementation and also makes it easy to apply image augmentations that would otherwise be harder to apply to bounding boxes, such as image rotation.

    To validate this approach, we compared our computed bounding boxes to those provided by the COCO dataset.
We found that ~2% of bounding boxes differed by 1px or more, ~0.05% differed by 5px or more, 
and only 0.01% differed by 10px or more.

* **Learning Rate:** The paper uses a learning rate of 0.02, but we found that to be
too high, and often causes the weights to explode, especially when using a small batch
size. It might be related to differences between how Caffe and TensorFlow compute 
gradients (sum vs mean across batches and GPUs). Or, maybe the official model uses gradient
clipping to avoid this issue. We do use gradient clipping, but don't set it too aggressively.
We found that smaller learning rates converge faster anyway so we go with that.
